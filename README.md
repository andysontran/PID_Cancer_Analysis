This repository contains R code for the curation of RNAseq data from tumour and normal tissue samples obtained from TCGA and GTEx, respectively, and provided by the recount2 project through the TCGAbiolinks Bioconductor/R package. Differential expression analysis (DEA) is performed using the *limma-voom* method with cut-offs at fold change > 2 or < -2 and p-value < 10e-16. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the pathfindR Bioconductor/R package. Project codes matching corresponding tumour and normal tissues are provided in Project_Codes.xlsx. PID-related genes were curated from the Fulgent Genetics 'Comprehensive Primary Immunodeficiency NGS Panel' and is provided in Panel_PIDGenes.xlsx.
